## Summary 

In recent years, the trending words ‘Big Data’ and ’Analytics’ heard in each and every field of study, especially in the applications and conjoining the terms with fields like Finance Analytics, Business Analytics, Risk Analytics, Data Analytics, and so on. In such a way, sports have also taken their journey, to have a scientific way of studying and analyzing the nature of tackling the game by the players’ performance and started using the new digital technological tools to bring out a lane with ‘Analytical View’, known to be “Sports Analytics.

Sports are associated with numerous games having huge amounts of information based on the past, which cannot be analyzed in a meaningful way. In this data tech world, due to expansion and innovation, social media shows the player's performance of the game in each and every angle that has inflated everyone from players to the viewers in and around 360 degrees. This article offers a pristine view of the exploration of statistical analysis in the emerging field of sports through analytics. The state of this study is to get a clear picture of Statistics and its subfields in the area of sports. This discussion also paves the way for the intensification of Sports and Analytics (especially a Statistician) to integrate the interdisciplinary approach in the upcoming decade and also view the screen behind the magic of sports analytics. So let's inchoate an overview of Sports Analytics with Statistics.


## WHY ATP ANALYSIS?


ATP tennis analytics, which involves the collection and analysis of data related to professional tennis matches and players on the ATP Tour (Association of Tennis Professionals), offer several benefits and serve various purposes:

*  ATP tennis analytics allow coaches and players to assess performance metrics such as serve speed, accuracy, shot placement, and movement patterns. This information helps players identify strengths and weaknesses, leading to targeted training and strategic adjustments.

*   For strategic development, Coaches and players can use data analytics to develop and refine game strategies. By analyzing opponents' playing styles and tendencies, they can devise game plans to exploit weaknesses and maximize their own strengths.

*   Injury Prevention Monitoring player movement patterns and physical exertion through analytics can help in injury prevention. Coaches and trainers can identify signs of fatigue or overexertion and adjust training regimens accordingly.

*   Scouting Opponents Players and coaches can use analytics to scout upcoming opponents. By studying historical performance data, they can gain insights into opponents' preferred shots, court positioning, and strategies, aiding in match preparation.

Our main focus was concentrating on the Post-match analysis of the ATP matches played across the globe in 2023 (till date). The dataset is collected from Jeff Sackman’s GitHub repository (tennis_atp/atp_matches_2023.csv). 
*   The data included the ATP player file, historical rankings, results, and match stats.
*   The player file columns are player_id, first_name, last_name, hand, birth_date, country_code, height (cm).
*   The columns for the ranking files are ranking_date, ranking, player_id, ranking_points (where available).
*   There are up to three files per season: One for tour-level main draw matches (e.g. 'atp_matches_2023.csv')
*   To make the results files easier for more people to use, the biographical and ranking files: each row contains several columns of biographical information, along with ranking and ranking points, for both players. 
*   Match Stats are included, which consisted (e.g. 1st serves in, not 1st serve percentage), from which traditional percentages can be calculated.


In conclusion, we can learn a lot about the ATP matches that took place in 2023 from the facts provided here. These are just the fundamental analyses that we have provided in this document. With the aid of more advanced ML and Statistics models, we can extract much more detailed information from the data that may be used in useful ways.
